        <p class="summary">
          I’m a software developer who focuses on making systems easier to understand, safer to change, and more reliable in practice.
          I work across backend services, tools, and system-heavy applications, applying proven design principles without over-engineering.
          <br /><br />
          Through <strong>McGregor Systems LLC</strong>, I provide contract engineering support for teams that need practical improvements, or small businesses that have no need for a team or long term Engineer.

            <h3>Engagement Focus</h3>
            <p>
              McGregor Systems LLC is the umbrella for my contract software engineering work. I take on engagements where a team needs someone who can
              understand an existing system quickly, make meaningful improvements, and leave it more maintainable than they found it. This typically
              involves stepping into live systems, diagnosing issues in place, and making targeted changes without disrupting ongoing operations.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Delivery Approach</h3>
            <p>
              I work by clarifying workflows and constraints, identifying failure points, and making incremental, well-scoped changes. Fixes are applied
              close to the source of the problem, with structure and documentation added where they reduce ambiguity and future friction.

    <!-- About Me-->
    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a systems-focused developer with experience spanning service-oriented architectures, application development, and performance-conscious simulation work.
        I care about code that stays understandable over time, has clear interfaces, contains intentional tradeoffs, and is constructed with design patterns and principles that don’t collapse under change.
        <br /><br />
        My background includes U.S. Air Force service and formal software-development training. I tend to be most valuable where a project needs structure:
        establishing architecture, untangling complexity, improving reliability, and leaving behind systems other engineers can work with confidently.

          <p>
            I step into existing systems that are unreliable or hard to change and make them stable again.
            This includes identifying root causes, fixing defects, and cleaning up fragile areas without
            disrupting day-to-day operations.
