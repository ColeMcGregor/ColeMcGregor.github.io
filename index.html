          If your tools feel fragile, your process relies on “that one spreadsheet,” or you and your team are stuck babysitting reports and systems
          that keep breaking, or can only be used in a very limited way, I can step in, diagnose what’s happening, and make it reliable again. 
          Alternatively, we can work together to build a new tool that meets your needs even better.
          <br /><br />
          I work with small businesses and teams that don’t have time to untangle technical problems, but still need things to run clean.

          <h3>“It works… except sometimes it doesn’t.”</h3>
          <p class="meta">Recurring bugs · brittle logic · surprise breakage</p>
          <p>
            Things break when one small change happens, and nobody is confident touching it.
            I stabilize the system, reduce and eliminate failure points, and leave it easier and far more understandable for you and/or your team to maintain.

          <h3>Manual work that shouldn’t be manual</h3>
          <p class="meta">Copy/paste workflows · spreadsheets holding the system together · preventable but confusing mistakes</p>
          <p>
            If the business runs on repetitive steps and experiantial knowledge, I can automate the right parts,
            add guardrails, and make outcomes predictable. This can be as simple as a script to copy and paste data from one system to another,
            or as complex as a full-fledged workflow automation tool. We can work together to build/find the right tool for your needs.

          <h3>Reports, PDFs, and client documents that keep breaking/ look bad/ are inconsistent</h3>
          <p class="meta">Layout issues · missing images · pagination bugs · data inconsistencies · inconsistent formatting</p>
          <p>
            I design and repair document/report generation so your outputs are consistent, readable,
            and safe to rely on long-term. This includes complex formatting, pagination, and data inconsistencies.

          <h3>Systems that don’t talk to each other</h3>
          <p class="meta">Disconnected tools · duplicate entry · inconsistent records</p>
          <p>
            I connect what you already use, reduce double-entry, and help you move data safely between systems. I can ensure that the data is also moved safely, consistently, and without errors.

          <p>
            You tell me what’s going wrong and what “done” looks like. If it’s not a fit, I’ll say so. I'll also ask you questions to help me understand the problem and your needs better.

          <h3>2) Discovery and planning</h3>

          <p>
            I trace the issue, map the moving parts, and propose a plan. This is the moment uncertainty turns into clarity.

          <p class="meta">Targeted changes</p>
          <p>
            I implement repairs/improvements, add guardrails where needed, communicate with you and/or your team as needed, and leave behind comprehensive documentation so you’re not stuck later. <em>Documentation guaranteed to be clear and easy to understand, tested by you and/or your team.</em>
