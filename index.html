          <h3>“It works… except sometimes it doesn’t.”</h3>
          <p class="meta">Recurring bugs · brittle logic · surprise breakage</p>
          <p>
            Things break when one small change happens, and nobody is confident touching it.
            I stabilize the system, reduce and eliminate failure points, and leave it easier and far more understandable for you and/or your team to maintain.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Manual work that shouldn’t be manual</h3>
          <p class="meta">Copy/paste workflows · spreadsheets holding the system together · preventable but confusing mistakes</p>
          <p>
            If the business runs on repetitive steps and experiantial knowledge, I can automate the right parts,
            add guardrails, and make outcomes predictable. This can be as simple as a script to copy and paste data from one system to another,
            or as complex as a full-fledged workflow automation tool. We can work together to build/find the right tool for your needs.

          <h3>Reports, PDFs, and client documents that keep breaking/ look bad/ are inconsistent</h3>
          <p class="meta">Layout issues · missing images · pagination bugs · data inconsistencies · inconsistent formatting</p>
          <p>
            I design and repair document/report generation so your outputs are consistent, readable,
            and safe to rely on long-term. This includes complex formatting, pagination, and data inconsistencies.

          <p class="meta">No clear starting point · confusing layout · weak first impression</p>
          <p>
            I design and build clear, professional websites from the ground up, or clean up and restructure
            existing ones. The focus is on presenting information in a way that’s easy to understand,
            easy to navigate, and works reliably on desktop and mobile, without unnecessary features or ongoing maintenance.

          <p class="meta">15 minutes</p>
          <p>
            You tell me what’s going wrong and what “done” looks like. If it’s not a fit, I’ll say so. I'll also ask you questions to help me understand the problem and your needs better.

          <h3>2) Discovery and planning</h3>
          <p class="meta">1–3 hours (usually)</p>
          <p>
            I trace the issue, map the moving parts, and propose a plan. This is the moment uncertainty turns into clarity.

          <p class="meta">Targeted changes</p>
          <p>
            I implement repairs/improvements, add guardrails where needed, communicate with you and/or your team as needed, and leave behind comprehensive documentation so you’re not stuck later. <em>Documentation guaranteed to be clear and easy to understand, tested by you and/or your team.</em>

        The fastest way to start is through a short contact form.
        Tell me what’s broken, what you’re trying to accomplish, or what’s slowing your team down.

      <p class="meta">
        Helpful details to include: where the issue lives (tool/site/app), who uses it,
        what’s currently painful, and what “working” would look like.
