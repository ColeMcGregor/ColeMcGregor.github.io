        <p class="summary">
          First and foremost, I am a father and a veteran. My daughter is my entire world, and together her and I work on little games and projects.
          Additionally, I am a software developer with experience in service-oriented architectures, game development, and systems design. 
          Games are my passion, and I enjoy learning and applying high-level concepts to create systems and games that are both elegant and impactful.
          My projects range from Kotlin/Android games to C++ ECS simulations, all reflecting my focus on clean abstractions and scalable design. 
          I’m passionate about learning, notably high-level concepts. From design patterns to Data-Oriented Design, 
          I take in concepts and enjoy applying them to create new and interesting projects that stimulate my love of learning and creation.

    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a developer who values both clean engineering and creative expression. My background includes service in the U.S. Air Force, where I learned discipline and teamwork, 
        and academic study of software development at Siena College. I enjoy applying high-level concepts such as design patterns and Data-Oriented Design to practical projects — 
        from scalable service-oriented architectures to immersive games and simulations.

          <p class="meta">Kotlin · Tile-Based · Turn-Based · Systems Design</p>
          <p>
            Explore a receding shoreline to uncover tidepools packed with shells and sea life. 
            Walk sand, skirt boulders, and collect from pools while the tide ebbs and floods in turns—get caught and lose two-thirds of your haul at random. 
            Farther, riskier pools yield rarer, more valuable finds.

          <h3>Fox & Rabbit</h3>
          <p class="meta">Java · Data Structures · Turn Engine</p>
          <p>
            Original version of the chase game on a 6×6 ring board, Advanced Programming Class Project.
            The Rabbit starts in the center and runs for rim carrots; the Fox starts on the outer ring, moves 3 steps, and hunts by scent. 
            The Rabbit moves 2 steps (or 3 after a failed Fox pounce). 
            Carrots appear on the rim, and when one is taken its two neighbors are locked out.
          </p>
          <p>This project was completed for an Advanced Programming course; code access is not public.</p>
